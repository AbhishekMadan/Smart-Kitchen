# Smart-Kitchen
ENY-Hackathon

##INTRODUCTION
Hackathon Event That Could Foud AT : https://eny.devpost.com/

####ENY
It is a button that simplifies our (users') lives by telling their smart home devices(Android App, IoT semsors) what to do. 
Example could be a stack of simple acticities that a user has to do everyday could be done by press of a button. 
viz. Switching on the Air Conditioner, Switching on the television and Switchin on the Lights.

####Neura SDK
It is an Android ADK which uses machine learning to learn from different day to day activities of a user and sensor data.
To get the most out of eny, we need it to understand and adapt to the user's day-to-day context.
We can track sensor data on users' devices and then analyzing it with proprietary machine learning algorithms, Neura gains an in-depth contextual knowledge of the customer.
With users' consent, Neura will share contextual insights about users with third party devices like eny to enable advanced personalization.

## Project Deliverables

[Idea Sheet]

##ARCHITECTURAL FLOW DIAGRAM

##	Technology Stack
Java, Python(To detect ENY button press and to carry the signal to node server), node.JS, JavaScript, Android Studio, Android SDK, Git, Angular.JS, HTML and CSS.

##USER STORIES
As a successful working professional and as a housewife Sita alwaya finds it hard to keep track of all the Groceries she needs to buy everyday.
This is where ENY button enabled with a simple Android app comes to her rescue.
The kitchen is now smart as the containers all have a simple weight sensors attached to them. Sensorical data is all connected to a node server and the server keeps track of each sensors.
You press an ENY button and your android app will send a notification to your registered mobile number with all the information you need regarding the groceries.
The Neura SDK will iteratively know which user is at the nearest to a market place and send him/her a text message of the things to buy.
This will simplify a users concern of having to keep a tab on the kitchen refills by making it a task of IoT sensors.
Android app provides a dashboard with favorite stores will automatically place orders when prompted. (If the APIs are exposed)
Use a single button to automate task of monitoring the kitchen supplies without having to manually intervene.

##FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
If any E-Retailer is willing to expose their APIs then we can easily integrate their store in our android app to automate the ordering from store.
If multiple stores are willing to share their APIs we can develope a mechanism of favourite store.
Registering multiple ENY devices to a single Android app.
Using real sensors and simulating the real IoT sensorical data.

##CONCLUSION
While in current technological era nothing seems impossible this idea definitely has a lot of impact on the future of our Kitchen.
